The blanket of snow stretches past the field and into a wooded area.&#x000A;&#x000A;Looking upon the stillness, sparseness, and emptiness of the snow, Desert Places reminds you of old memories, of evening meals back when you used to return home.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[3] x evening meals&#x000A;As you gaze into the blank white snow, you remember the white tablecloth that covered your family's dining room table. Your mind drifts to the last time you visited them and... that meal.&#x000A;&#x000A;Dining Room Table - some years ago&#x000A;You are seated at a large rectangular dining table of stained cherry wood. A large window across from you peers out into the back yard. Outside, daylight is fading and snow is driving down and into the window in a tempestuous fury. The wind outside moans as the panels of the wall gently and nervingly creak.&#x000A;&#x000A;You feel the room's vent blasting a humid and suffocating stream of hot air into the back of your head.&#x000A;&#x000A;A plain and thin white tablecloth covers the tabletop. On the table, assorted silverware and serving dishes are neatly laid out. Unlit candles span down the spine of the table. In front of you is a bowl of chicken noodle soup, a salad in a salad bowl, and a dinner plate with slices of ham, potatoes, and mixed vegetables. Next to your dinner plate rest a salad fork, a dinner fork, a knife, and a spoon.&#x000A;&#x000A;Parent One, Parent Two, Relative One, and Sibling One are seated around the table. Desert Places is still with you in your mind as you relive this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is a quiet stillness in the air. A tension that something is about to start, but hasn't yet.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[4] test dining-room-test&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[5] x tablecloth&#x000A;Freshly pressed for the occasion, all of its folds and wrinkles have been smoothed out. Plain white, white as snow, with no art or decoration or frills to speak up. No life or charm. You remember that the table had intricate, hand-carved floral patterns atop the table. Now it is smothered by the plain, snow white tablecloth.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[6] x soup&#x000A;Chicken noodle soup. Most likely completely absent of any seasoning or flavor. The bowl is full of a yellow-tinted broth, with white noodles floating to the surface, and tiny cubes of chicken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[7] eat soup&#x000A;(with the spoon)&#x000A;You dip the spoon into the soup, trying your best to capture both noodles and chicken into the spoon. As you raise the spoon, some of the noodles just slide off the spoon, but you don't really mind or care. Just as you expected, the soup is bland and utterly devoid of any flavor. Eating feels more like mechanical busywork than a satisfying sensory experience. A job to do. You pause and focus on the warmth of the broth as it makes its way down your chest. A silver lining.&#x000A;&#x000A;Parent One darts a glare in your direction as you eat the soup. "Ex-cuse me? What do you think you're doing?" Parent One shouts in a voice louder than the moment probably warrants.&#x000A;&#x000A;"I'm... hungry?" you answer in a hushed but transparently snarky tone. Desert Places piles on with a snarky retort you dare not say out loud, "Why else does a person eat food?" You didn't really want to break the tension. But you couldn't help yourself.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Why are you...." she lets out an exasperated sigh. "Why are you like this? We've gone over this many, many times. You know better than this. We start after we give our thanks. Now come on!"&#x000A;&#x000A;You close your eyes, roll your eyes upward, clench your jaw, and immediately tense your entire body up, squeezing the empty spoon in your hand in the process. In that moment, you feel like could just forego the food-- anything to remove yourself from this moment. Your will to remain here has evaporated. Every fiber of your being wants to drop the spoon into the soup and leave. Or make some other kind of commotion.&#x000A;&#x000A;Desert Places speaks as you replay this moment, "Why did I put up with this?"&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[8] drop spoon&#x000A;You drop the empty spoon from some height into the bowl of soup. The yellow liquid splashes in all directions, including down onto the pure white tablecloth. Little dots of soup and little cubes of chicken sprawled everywhere.&#x000A;&#x000A;"HEY!" screams Parent Two. The echo of Parent Two's voice pierces through the house and tapers off in an instant, and you recoil because you know what's about to happen. You steel yourself. Relative One stands up from their chair out of pure instinct and rushes to Sibling One like a shield-bearing paladin. They know too. "WE WORKED HARD TO PUT THIS TOGETHER. HOW DARE YOU. FUCK YOU. WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? THIS IS THE MRMMM MRRM MRMM...." you shut off and stop paying attention to the words and now all you want to do is look around to find something, anything, to focus your eyes on.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[9] look&#x000A;Dining Room Table - some years ago&#x000A;You look out the window. It's darker outside, but the snow is still coming down just as hard. You notice the snow piling up outside on the window sill. You look down at the blotched tablecloth. You feel regret, bitterness, disdain, shame... and loneliness. You then look into the foyer and see the coat rack near the front door.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a spoon, a coat, Desert Places, and a soup here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[10] pick up coat&#x000A;"MMRMM MRMMM MRRRMMRRMM?" you hear as you walk to the coatrack to put your winterwear on. At the time, you probably did comprehend what the question was, but you didn't acknowledge it with any answer. Desert Places interjects, "Maybe I could have scraped back some dignity and respect?" still grappling with the moment. You shake your head as you remember putting on your coat and hat and boots. ".... LET. IT. GO!" you hear Parent One shout in the distance as Parent Two turns their ire away from you.&#x000A;&#x000A;You are resolved to create space for yourself, and you're going to go out for a walk. Alone. You'd rather brave the blizzard outside temporariy than put up with this. "I'm done with this," you mutter under your breath. And then you're back on Hearth Road.&#x000A;&#x000A;Hearth Road&#x000A;When you snap back from the memory, you take in the stillness and expressionlessness of the field and the woods, as the snow gently falls and a cold breeze gusts across your body.&#x000A;&#x000A;None of them are in your life. You had to do that, to create that space. But the scars and the bitterness remain. Desert Places interjects, unable to let go of the moment, "Was that the only option I had?" You process the self-doubt and counter with another thought, "The constant questioning though. The pressure to conform. I'm not going to endure that. No. Fuck that."&#x000A;&#x000A;You continue down Hearth Road and notice some of the stars in the sky fading into morning light.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[11] test back-from-dining-room&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[12] x stars&#x000A;As you turn your gaze up, you notice that the stars higher in the sky are more visible, so you crane your neck up to find them. As your eye darts between the numerous stars you see, you focus for a moment on the slow and gentle pulse of their twinkle. Desert Places seizes the moment to provide their customary opinion, "Why do I spend so much time thinking about what's out there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Because...." the words tumble from your mind, scrambling to riposte. But you catch yourself. You pause and think about the vastness, the coldness, and the indifference of space. But it doesn't scare you or bother you. Desert Places conjures up an imaginary place for you to daydream about. Your mind paints a rough image of a barstool in front of a bar.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[13] x barstool&#x000A;A metal four-legged stool with a soft, round, red cushion on top. You release into the daydream as you think about taking a seat on this barstool, somewhere far away.&#x000A;&#x000A;End of the Universe&#x000A;You are in an outdoor, open air venue. By all accounts, it looks like a restaurant, but the place is quiet and deserted. You're seated on a metal barstool among a row of barstools in front of a bar. Behind you, an assortment of metal tables and metal chairs. The ground around the venue is dusty and rocky. The sky overhead swirls in a mixture of violet, midnight blue, and purple, and streaks of large galaxies and bright stars of all sorts of colors are scattered in all directions, as far as you can see.&#x000A;&#x000A;Desert Places accompanies you.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[14] test end-of-the-universe&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[15] x bar&#x000A;You spot a few tumblers and glasses turned over on the bar top in front of some of the other stools. There's a layer of dust that's collected on the bar. Bottles of various drinks are neatly stowed away on the shelves behind the bar. No one is operating the bar.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[16] x tables&#x000A;There isn't anyone seated at any table. The chairs around all of the tables are upright. Some chairs are tucked under their table, some are not. Despite the deafening silence, there isn't anything noteworthy about the arrangement of the chairs. You do however spot a tab on one of the tables.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[17] x tab&#x000A;It's a piece of rectangular paper with a list of items and prices written on it. As you look at the tab, you notice that there's a thick film of dust that's formed on the table. You can't really make out what's written on the tab, but it almost seems like someone's recently been here. You look around the venue again, as if to double check your initial impression, and there is still nobody around.&#x000A;&#x000A;Desert Places then speaks up, "I bet a lot of stars are like this, if humans are out there. Completely empty and dead. I wouldn't be surprised though."&#x000A;&#x000A;You bristle at this intrusive thought, but then you notice a ma&#x00EE;tre d' station in the distance that you didn't notice when you first got here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[18] x station&#x000A;You walk over to a plain podium made of solid white wood where someone normally stands to greet guests and patrons. There's a guestbook on the station.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[19] x guestbook&#x000A;The guestbook is bound in white leather and it keeps a record of reservations of the restaurant's guests and assigns seats and tables to patrons. Several pages are filled in this manner. But near the end of the guestbook, the reservation records stop. The last thing written in the guestbook is a message a ma&#x00EE;tre d" probably left behind, "I meet and greet people, all day, every day, from every corner of this universe. And yet I feel utterly alone and miserable. Nobody gets it. We're all going to be forced to stop this charade soon anyway. So, why do we keep doing this? Maybe there doesn't need to be a reason. It gives me something to do, I guess."&#x000A;&#x000A;Desert Places comments, "The dying words of a world that knew it was on the brink, but not when it would happen. Isn't it interesting how we can be around people for a living and still feel alone?"&#x000A;&#x000A;You spot a coat rack near the ma&#x00EE;tre d' station with your coat on it.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[20] pick up coat&#x000A;Annoyed at the snide commentary of Desert Places, you grab your coat and hat and boots, and put them on, and you try to create some kind of psychological distance from these thoughts. "I'm done with this," you mutter in a huff as you walk out of the memory and back onto Hearth Road.&#x000A;&#x000A;Hearth Road&#x000A;As you come back from the daydream at the end of the universe, you catch yourself still staring out at the snowy field. You've lingered at the fence longer than you wanted to, and so you gather yourself and continue walking down Hearth Road. As you approach a parking lot, you catch wind of some kind of bustle, but you can't quite tell what's going on.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[21] test before-parking-lot&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[22] x parking lot&#x000A;You meander over to the parking lot to get a better look at what's going on, a little scared of what you might find. There are a few popup canopies and some barbecue grills set up, and about a dozen people gathered around the parking lot. You can see snow clumped up on the tops of the canopies and some shoveled snow around the grills. You hear the sounds of laughter and conversation, and the aromas of burning charcoal and wood and food in the air. People of all ages with knit hats and heavy coats are smothered together around heating lamps or the barbecue grills.&#x000A;&#x000A;Desert Places butts in, "Let's get out of here. Leave them alone." Hearth Road continues north.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[23] n&#x000A;You don't think anyone in the parking lot has spotted you, so you pull down the knit cap further down over your head, and scurry northward down the street. The wind blasts in your face and you feel your hands getting colder and number as you try frantically to warm your body and secure yourself some distance.&#x000A;&#x000A;But then you hear a voice pierce the wind from the parking lot, "Hellooooo! Hey! Waiiiiiit! We've got food and drinks here!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Every fiber of your being wants to keep running away. But it is cold and you're not doing anything important. So you halt your scurrying, close your eyes, and let out a steam-filled sigh. You ponder the offer for a moment. Sure, it's probably fine, you think. "...Okay!" you shout back awkwardly. You turn back towards the parking lot and see a stocky woman with a powder blue knit cap and matching jacket with a relieved and approving smile on her face. "Come on in!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Not quite sure what else you should do, you carefully step into the parking lot.&#x000A;&#x000A;Parking Lot&#x000A;There's some kind of informal social gathering that has assembled in a public parking lot. Piles of snow several feet high form a semi-circle behind the gathering. The snow has been shoveled away to carve out a space for their equipment: barbecue grills, pop up canopies with powder blue tops, and big heat lamps. There's also a camping stove and a covered cooking pot over the stove. People of all ages are casually crisscrossing around the makeshift camp and all seem to be in good spirits.&#x000A;&#x000A;You see a young adolescent with heavy gloves darting towards you carrying a small steaming pot. Some sort of drink or meal, you think. Behind the young adolescent, you spot the lady who invited you keeping a watchful eye on the young adolescent. The young adolescent says, "Hi, welcome!" as they carefully set down the steaming pot on the ground. "We like coming out here with our neighbors. I don't think I've seen you before."&#x000A;&#x000A;You feel a little overwhelmed by everything going on, not quite sure that you feel safe about being in the parking lot, but you're willing to give it a try. They seem nice enough folk. "Yeah, I usually take my walks in the evenings, so this parking lot is usually empty then."&#x000A;&#x000A;"Ah, ok," the young adolescent says. "My name's Max. You hungry? Here," as they offer you a pewter mug and a ladle.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[24] test in-parking-lot&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[25] take pewter mug&#x000A;As you pick up the mug, you notice the word OASIS in bright yellow lettering around the mug.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[26] take ladle&#x000A;"All right, so... what's in here?" you say as you catch a waft of an aromatic and warm aroma coming from the pot.&#x000A;&#x000A;"It's a stew. I like it a lot. It's tasty," Max says as they lift the lid off the pot. You catch the full force of the smell of the stew as they do this, and you have to turn your head and cough from its power.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Wow... *cough* ...all right," you say in a strained voice, trying to remain polite.&#x000A;&#x000A;"You ok?" Max asks.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah, I'm just.... *cough* ...not used to food smelling like that," you reply with a wry chuckle at the end.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Go on, try some," Max encourages.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[27] put ladle in pot&#x000A;You dip the ladle into the hearty stew. It's a thick stew with an assortment of herbs, spices, aromatics, vegetables and meats. You're mainly interested in the broth, so you fill the ladle with the liquid broth from the pot.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[28] put ladle in mug&#x000A;You deftly pour the contents of the ladle from one hand into the mug you're carrying in the other hand and fill it near the top. You place the ladle back into the pot and you wrap both of your hands around the mug and close your eyes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The warmth of the stew through the mug immediately dethaws your numbing hands, you notice how the warmth guides its way through your arms, and you exhale. You take a moment to take in the aroma of the stew again, now more prepared for its potency. It's warm and inviting.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[29] drink from pewter mug&#x000A;You tip the mug and take a drink of the stew, and while the flavors are strong, it isn't overwhelming. This is a stew that's been made with care and joy and love. "What am I even doing here?" Desert Places says in your head. A question you promptly discard.&#x000A;&#x000A;The lady with the powder blue knit cap and jacket walks up behind Max, "Hope you like it! We love doing stuff like this. We always make a little extra of what we make, in case we see people passing by." You look up at the two of them with a quizzical look, your brain locks up and the only thing you can think of asking is "Why do you do that?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Are you kidding me?" the lady says half exasperated. The lady puts her hands on her hips, and continues, "Nobody out here should freeze. All of us look out for each other. The people over there were very kind to me when I needed help, and so this is what I do to try to give back. We do this together."&#x000A;&#x000A;You look back down into the stew in the pewter mug, as you process their compassion to complete strangers. You decide to reply back to the previously ignored question from Desert Places.&#x000A;&#x000A;We fill our empty spaces with people to connect, To share the warmth of our fires and affect The people we're around so they're not alone, It's how we move forward, I suspect.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Come on over and meet everyone," the lady says.&#x000A;&#x000A;You smile and say, "All right."&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;    *** The End ***&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, or UNDO the last command?&#x000A;&gt;</result>

You feel the room's vent blasting very warm air into the back of your head.&#x000A;&#x000A;A plain and thin white tablecloth covers the tabletop. On the table, assorted silverware and serving dishes are neatly laid out. Unlit candles span down the spine of the table. In front of you is a bowl of chicken noodle soup, a salad in a salad bowl, and a dinner plate with slices of ham, potatoes, and mixed vegetables. Next to your dinner plate rest a salad fork, a dinner fork, a knife, and a spoon.&#x000A;&#x000A;Parent One, Parent Two, Relative One, and Sibling One are seated around the table.

A piercing echo of Parent Two's voice runs throughout the house and tapers off in an instant, and you recoil because you know what's about to happen. You steel yourself.

Your mind drifts to the last time you visited them and... that meal.&#x000A;&#x000A;Dining Room Table - some years ago&#x000A;You are seated at a large rectangular dining table of stained cherry wood. A large window across from you peers out into the back yard. Outside, daylight is fading and snow is driving down in a tempestuous fury. You feel the room's vent blasting very warm air into the back of your head.&#x000A;&#x000A;A plain and thin white tablecloth covers the tabletop. On the table, assorted silverware and serving dishes are neatly laid out. Unlit candles span down the spine of the table. In front of you is a bowl of chicken noodle soup, a salad in a salad bowl, and a dinner plate with slices of ham, potatoes, and mixed vegetables. Next to your dinner plate rest a salad fork, a dinner fork, a knife, and a spoon.&#x000A;&#x000A;Parent One, Parent Two, Relative One, and Sibling One are seated around the table. Desert Places is still with you in your mind as you relive this moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is a quiet stillness in the air. A tension that something is about to start, but hasn't yet.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[4] test dining-room-test&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[5] x tablecloth&#x000A;Freshly pressed for the occasion, all of its folds and wrinkles have been smoothed out. Plain white, white as snow, with no art or decoration or frills to speak up. No life or charm. You remember that the table had intricate, hand-carved floral patterns atop the table. Now it is smothered by the plain, snow white tablecloth.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[6] x soup&#x000A;Chicken noodle soup. Most likely completely absent of any seasoning or flavor. The bowl is full of a yellow-tinted broth, with small pale noodles floating to the surface, and small cubes of pale chicken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[7] eat soup&#x000A;(with the spoon)&#x000A;You dip the spoon into the soup, trying your best to capture both noodles and chicken into the spoon. As you raise the spoon, some of the noodles just slide off the spoon, but you don't really mind or care. Just as you expected, the soup is bland and utterly devoid of any flavor. Eating feels more like mechanical busywork than a satisfying sensory experience. A job to do. You do feel the warmth of the broth course through your body. A silver lining.&#x000A;&#x000A;Parent One darts a glare in your direction as you eat the soup. "Ex-cuse me? What do you think you're doing?" Parent One shouts in a voice louder than the moment probably warrants.&#x000A;&#x000A;"I'm... hungry?" you answer in a hushed but transparently snarky tone. Desert Places piles on with a silent retort you dare not say out loud, "Why else does a person eat food?" You didn't really want to break the tension. But you couldn't help yourself.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Why are you...." she lets out an exasperated sigh. "Why are you like this? We've gone over this many, many times. You know better than this. We start after we give our thanks."&#x000A;&#x000A;You close your eyes, roll your eyes upward, clench your jaw, and immediately tense your entire body up, as you squeeze the empty spoon in your hand. In that moment, you feel like could just forego the food, just so you can remove yourself from this moment. Your will to remain here is basically zero. Every fiber of your being wants to drop the spoon into the soup and leave. Or make some other kind of commotion.&#x000A;&#x000A;Desert Places speaks as you replay this moment, "Why did I put up with this?"&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[8] drop spoon&#x000A;You drop the empty spoon from some height into the full bowl of soup. The yellow liquid splashes in all directions, including down onto the pure white tablecloth. Little dots of soup and little cubes of chicken are clear to see.&#x000A;&#x000A;"HEY!" screams Parent Two. A sharp echo of Parent Two's voice runs throughout the house and tapers off, and you recoil because you know what's about to happen. You steel yourself. Relative One stands up from their chair out of instinct and rushes to Sibling One like a shield-bearing paladin. They know too. "WE WORKED HARD TO PUT THIS TOGETHER. HOW DARE YOU. FUCK YOU. WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? THIS IS THE MRMMM MRRM MRMM...." you shut off and stop paying attention to the words and now all you want to do is look around to find something, anything, to focus your eyes on.&#x000A;&#x000A;You do like to fidget, but you withhold your urges for now.&#x000A;&#x000A;Dropped.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

As you raise the spoon, some of the noodles just slide off the spoon, but you don't really mind or care. Just as you expected, the soup is bland and utterly devoid of any flavor. Eating feels more like mechanical busywork than a satisfying sensory experience. A job to do. You do feel the warmth of the broth course through your body. A silver lining.&#x000A;&#x000A;Parent One darts a glare in your direction as you eat the soup. "Ex-cuse me? What do you think you're doing?" Parent One says in a voice louder than the moment probably warrants.&#x000A;&#x000A;"I'm... hungry?" you answer in a hushed but transparently snarky tone. Desert Places piles on in your mind, "Why else does a person eat food?" You really didn't want to break the tension. Again. But you couldn't help yourself.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Why are you...." she lets out an exasperated sigh. "Why are you like this? We've gone over this many, many times. You _know_ better than this. We start after we give our thanks."&#x000A;&#x000A;You close your eyes, roll your eyes upward, clench your jaw, and immediately tense your entire body up, as you squeeze the empty spoon in your hand. In that moment, you feel like could just forego the food, just so you can remove yourself from this moment. Your will to remain here is basically zero. Every fiber of your being wants to drop the spoon into the soup and leave. Or make some other kind of commotion.&#x000A;&#x000A;Desert Places speaks as you replay this moment, "Why did I put up with this?"&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[8] drop spoon&#x000A;Dropped.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
